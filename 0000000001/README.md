## Reasons for an Explainer Story

Explainer videos are a great way to introduce a subject or concept in a succinct way. This might be a quick overview of your product, service, or company. Either way, it’s an easy point of entry for people who don’t otherwise know about your brand.


## Guidelines of an Explainer Story

The idea is that audio and visual channels work separately in the brain, so when content is presented simultaneously by way of audio and visual channels—say, on-screen images and voice over—the information is processed faster and with greater ease.

A strong story determines the success of your entire explainer video because it drives both the audio and visual components.

### How to Write a Good Explainer Video Script

There are two aspects of an explainer video script: the story itself and how you decide to tell that story. The story is the foundation of it all, so nailing that first is imperative. Here’s how to do it.

#### 1) Identify Your Story

All too often we see explainers that have convoluted messaging, meander all over the place, or wait until the very last second to get to the damn point. Sometimes it’s so distracting it actually does more damage than having no explainer at all. Do not make this mistake. Your job is to tell one specific story in a clear, concise way. 


Your story will likely fall into one of two categories: problem-solution or process walkthrough. There are nuances to each, as subtle as they may be. Following these narrative formats will help you craft a strong explainer video script.

| Story Category | Description | Our Choice |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Process Overview | This tactic may be used for a service overview or a product how-to. In this approach, there’s no problem. It’s a self-contained story. Outline your narrative in clear beats, moving from one point to the next cleanly and efficiently. | MAIN STORY LINE: The purpose, use and benefit of a Roadmap |
| Problem-Solution | This is the classic way to pose your company product or service as the hero that makes your viewer’s life easier. Make the problem clear and relatable, then use the story arc to make a natural transition to the solution. Note: Don’t spend more time on the problem than the solution. You want to leave them fantasizing about your awesome product or service, not ruminating on the frustrating problem. | SUB-PLOT: The specific Initiative/Tactic of the Episode, that serves as an example of and is told within the overarching story of the use of a Roadmap. |
