## Reasons for an Explainer Story

Explainer videos are a great way to introduce a subject or concept in a succinct way. This might be a quick overview of your product, service, or company. Either way, it’s an easy point of entry for people who don’t otherwise know about your brand.


## Guidelines of an Explainer Story

The idea is that audio and visual channels work separately in the brain, so when content is presented simultaneously by way of audio and visual channels—say, on-screen images and voice over—the information is processed faster and with greater ease.

A strong story determines the success of your entire explainer video because it drives both the audio and visual components.
